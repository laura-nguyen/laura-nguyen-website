          It's your friendly neighbour growth marketer and a software developer
          from Toronto, Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my small space on the internet. An experimental &
          ever-changing (verging on self-absorbed) space to share who I am, what
          I've done, what Iâ€™m doing now, what I like, and what I capture. This
          is my formal introduction to the internet. Through lines of code, and
          a lot of good vibes.
        </p>
        <p>In other words, it's nice to meet you.</p>
